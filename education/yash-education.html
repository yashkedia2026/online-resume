            <p class="pd">
                I am pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science</strong> at <strong>Boston
                University</strong>, Boston, MA, with an expected graduation date of May 2026.
                My current CGPA is <strong>3.60/4.0</strong>, and I have been recognized on the <strong>Dean’s List for
                four semesters</strong>.
                My academic journey has provided a balanced exposure to both theoretical and applied aspects of computer
                science.
                I have studied foundational subjects like Discrete Mathematics and Linear Algebra, which strengthen my
                logical reasoning, along with applied courses such as Computer Systems and Software Engineering, which
                train me to design and implement reliable software systems.
                Some of the key coursework I have completed includes <em>Data Structures (Java), Discrete Mathematics,
                Computer Systems, Linear Algebra, Analysis of Algorithms, Probability, Programming Languages,</em> and
                <em>Software Engineering</em>.
                Beyond my required courses, I actively participate in hackathons, mini-projects, and self-driven coding
                challenges. Applying principles from Software Engineering, I have built structured and testable
                projects, while my Computer Systems coursework sparked my interest in distributed systems and
                optimization, which I continue to explore through academic projects and internships. This blend of
                classroom learning and practical application has been critical in shaping me into a well-rounded
                computer science student prepared for industry challenges.

            <p class="pd">
                I completed my schooling at <strong>St. James’ School, Kolkata</strong>, one of the oldest and most
                prestigious schools in the city. My years at St. James’ instilled in me discipline, leadership, and a
                strong academic foundation across sciences, mathematics, and the humanities. The rigorous curriculum and
                co-curricular activities at St. James’ prepared me for the transition to higher education abroad and
                shaped my values of integrity, resilience, and teamwork. My time there laid the groundwork for my later
                achievements at Boston University and continues to be an important part of my educational identity.
