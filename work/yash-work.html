                    <p>
                        I worked as a <strong>Software Development Intern</strong> at R Systems, Kolkata (June–July
                        2024).
                        My primary responsibility was to develop a Python tool that integrated OpenAI GPT and LLaMA
                        models
                        to automate financial document analysis for public companies. This project reduced manual
                        processing
                        effort by nearly <strong>40%</strong>. I also automated the extraction of financial data from
                        corporate
                        websites using BeautifulSoup, which improved monthly reporting speed and data accessibility.

                        As a <strong>Portfolio Management Intern</strong> at Kalptaru Investments (March–April 2021),
                        I performed financial data analysis and due diligence that influenced strategic capital
                        allocations
                        of around <strong>$20,000</strong>. I also managed a portfolio worth approximately <strong>$200,000</strong>,
                        implementing options and futures trading strategies that helped the firm achieve a
                        <strong>24% return on investment</strong>. This experience gave me practical exposure to
                        financial
                        markets and sharpened my quantitative skills.

                    <p>
                        At <strong>Kedia Fintrade Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, I contributed to investment research and market
                        analysis
                        in a family-managed financial services environment. My work included tracking equity and
                        derivatives
                        markets, supporting decision-making for trades, and gaining insights into wealth management and
                        portfolio growth strategies. This role helped me build a stronger foundation in finance and
                        complemented my later internships in software and portfolio management.
